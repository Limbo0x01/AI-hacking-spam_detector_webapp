SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning
A machine learning model that classifies SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam) based on their content. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms to detect unwanted messages.

Features
âœ… Preprocessing of SMS text (removal of stopwords, tokenization, vectorization)
âœ… Machine learning models trained on labeled SMS datasets
âœ… Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
âœ… Easy-to-use script for testing custom messages

Tech Stack
ðŸ”¹ Python (pandas, scikit-learn, nltk)
ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning (NaÃ¯ve Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees, etc.)
ðŸ”¹ Jupyter Notebook for training and analysis
